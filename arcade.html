<span id="arcaderoundbulk">
Donkey Kong was released by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> on July 9th 1981. 
It was one of the most influential arcade games of the golden age, it introduced many new concepts that have been used ever since even in video game genre other than it's own. 
It was one of the first platformer games and it started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)">Mario franchise</a>, named after the main character "Jumpman" that was eventually named "Mario". 
The Mario franchise is the best selling video game franchise of all time selling atleast 528.534 million copies, 311.46 million copies coming just from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario">Super Mario franchise</a> which is also the second biggest best selling video game franchise. 
While Pac-Man is arguably the first game to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene">cutscenes</a>, Donkey Kong introduced the concept of using "cutscenes" to tell a story without player input to "advance the plot" and "intergrate multiple stages into the gameplay". 
Cutscenes are now used in almost every single modern video game, and it would be almost impossible to find a modern video game that focuses on the story that doesn't have cutscenes.
