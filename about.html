I am a year 13 student(24/08/2017) in New Zealand that is interested in computers and video games, including older games and computers.
I have decided to make this website based on my interest in old arcade, console and computer games, Specifically those that have defined game genres and affected the video game industry.
Pi-Walrus is being designed as of 17/08/2017 for my Level 3 Media Studies project
